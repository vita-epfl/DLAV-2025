### Final Project: End-to-End Planning for Autonomous Driving

---

#### 1. Introduction

End-to-end planning for autonomous driving is a rapidly growing area in intelligent transportation systems. The goal is to design a model that can directly map raw sensor inputs to vehicle control commands. Unlike modular pipelines, this approach simplifies the decision-making stack and has shown great promise in improving robustness and real-time adaptability.

This project invites you to build an end-to-end deep learning-based planner that outputs future trajectories for a self-driving car using sensor data. The development will proceed in three progressive phases, each deepening your understanding and expanding your model's capabilities.

#### 2. Dataset Overview

We use a curated subset of the [nuPlan dataset](https://www.nuscenes.org/nuplan) with simulated sensors, the world’s first large-scale planning benchmark for autonomous vehicles.

- **Training Set**: 5,000 samples
- **Validation Set**: 1,000 samples

##### Data Format
Each data point is structured as a Python dictionary with the following keys:

```python
{
    'camera': ndarray (200, 300, 3),               # RGB image simulated at time step 21 
    'depth': ndarray (200, 300, 1),                # Depth image at time step 21
    'driving_command': str,                        # One of ['forward', 'left', 'right']
    'sdc_history_feature': ndarray (21, 3),        # [x, y, heading] from past 21 steps
    'sdc_future_feature': ndarray (60, 3),         # [x, y, heading] for the next 60 steps
    'semantic_label': ndarray (200, 300)           # Semantic segmentation map
}
```

- All coordinates are ego-rotated to the vehicle's local frame at time step 21.
- Only `'camera'`, `'driving_command'`, and `'sdc_history_feature'` are allowed as inputs for **Milestone 1**.

##### Semantic Colormap
```python
semantic_colormap = {
    0: (0, 0, 0),         # UNLABELED
    1: (0, 0, 142),       # CAR
    2: (0, 0, 70),        # TRUCK
    3: (220, 20, 60),     # PEDESTRIAN
    4: (119, 11, 32),     # BIKE
    5: (152, 251, 152),   # TERRAIN
    6: (128, 64, 128),    # ROAD
    7: (244, 35, 232),    # SIDEWALK
    8: (70, 130, 180),    # SKY
    9: (250, 170, 30),    # TRAFFIC_LIGHT
    10: (190, 153, 153),  # FENCE
    11: (220, 220, 0),    # TRAFFIC_SIGN
    12: (255, 255, 255),  # LANE_LINE
    13: (55, 176, 189),   # CROSSWALK
    14: (0, 60, 100)      # BUS
}
```
